1) You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

2) Very simple, given an integer or a floating-point number, find its opposite.

Examples:

1: -1
14: -14
-34: 34

3) It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

4) Write a function called repeatStr which repeats the given string string exactly n times.

repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"
